Born in the core and steeped in the omninet, it only took a handful of chance encounters for Lyn Kittel to become introduced to the less regulated corners of the net which eventually led to those who know more about NHPs than the UIB wants the average human in Union space to know. Piercing the veil her own way took time and effort, but she was rewarded with knowledge, a companion, and so much more. Including a visit from Union. Turns out that having an unshackled NHP in a civilian's hands is not cool by their standards. In order to keep her new partner by her side, they struck a deal and enrolled in the pilot's academy, begrudgingly.

Her newfound friend/brain-roommate, Azad√Æ, is shy around the outwardly friendly appearances of Union. They are content to perform their duties alongside their pilot without much comment, for now.
